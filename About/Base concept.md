A girl whom got herself trapped inside of her own mind. In which to escape she has to face her greatest fears and let the past go.

In it, the girl found herself in a school she used to attend. Which she moved away from due to her peers being harsh to her and her own mental state. In it she explores whats left of the school in her memory. Bit by bit briefly looking back at it, and only after that she lets each of it go.

The catch is that there is still some bits of her memory that she is still fond of. Some few close friends that she had. Someone that did helped her survive. Someone close. And also some places of importance to her. Some places in that school where she did found peace without the hindrance of the people.

In the end, the little bits of memories that she left and haven't moved on from disintegrates forms another smaller place. The "leftovers" from her memories. Made from the things she still stuck on. 
Until finally after some courage she sacrifices that place and the dream sequence ends.

The short ends with a shot of her in real life looking content with what she has. She prepares for a new day, opens the front door, and leave the house without the burdens of her past.

## Worlds
