Her initial draft design was drawn by noviden.

At that point we didn't really base it off of anything. But after a while I've started to notice characters that _did_ look similar to her and started basing Ayuki's design closer to them instead.

Shian's design (and general character) is VERY close to what I had in mind and it's actually kind of uncanny seeing practically the character I have in my head already existing.

It's very lucky though because now this means I have a proven design to closely reference.

Aoba and Chisato were eventually put into our catalog of references. Specifically for that "Childlike"ness and the twintails.
