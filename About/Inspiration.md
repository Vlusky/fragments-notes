So this is actually based on my personal experience. I entered a school with not so nice people, before i finally snapped and moved out.
Memories of just people harassing me and just not caring.
Only ever come to me for favors and never gave anything back in return. Even ridiculing me outside of it.
(don't worry about it i'm in a better place now. why else would i make a whole movie about it?)
	
But there are still some memories of that place that i'm still fond of. The little group of friends I did made, my interactions with them and how they helped me. The teachers that are still supportive of what I did.
I left without saying goodbye to them.

The actual idea of the "leftovers" actually came to me in a dream. I saw a small modest hut, a wide rice field, and... someone...
Upon asking that someone what the place is the person replies:
```
"This is the bit of your memory that you still haven't let go...
this place is the embodiment of the little memories you're fond of...
You did have a reason to go, you're not strong enough.
...But, do you regret leaving all of these behind?"
```

Answer for which I'm still not sure.
I sometimes still think about the friends I have made there... I hope they are doing well without me.
