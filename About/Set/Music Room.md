A room which [[Ayuki Kazune]] and [[Natsume Ueda]] would often hang out together.

## In Setting
This is the first place that Ayuki couldn't move away from. Upon trying to move on from it, she snaps and cries onto the floor. The place in her memory too looks like it was protected by an unknown force.

## Lore
Ayuki one day walks into the music room for a visit when she first entered this school. She has an interest in music although she never really opened up to people about it. But she is still curious.

Upon entering she met Natsume. Whom are playing the piano then. Ayuki compliments her beautiful playing and after that, they chatted together and agreed to do music together.

Natsume is the sole member of the music club and she's about to graduate. And upon seeing a new first year in her room she was ecstatic. She herself feels like an older sister to Ayuki.

Eventually Ayuki opened up to Natsume. On the struggles she's been dealing with. Natsume doesn't really know what to do but she still tries to help Ayuki the best to her ability. Even if it's just giving her someone to talk to. Someone that will listen.

When Natsume graduated, Ayuki then had no one else. She had lost the one person that she can talk to. And with her only lifeline gone, she started going towards a downwards spiral.

## The Duet
Ayuki plays the guitar whereas Natsume as we went through previously plays the piano. They would often play together and sometimes compose new songs.
