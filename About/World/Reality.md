#### About
It's... well... "real life". The stuff that actually happens. 

#### Style
- Stylized 3D or mixed 2D (inspired by SANZIGEN)

#### "flashback" reality and "reality" reality
- during the duration of the short, Ayuki would sometimes flashback to her past. be they her traumatic moments or eventually her _treasured_ moments.
- at the end of the short, a "real" real version of Ayuki with a different uniform - signifying that she moved schools, is shown.
- the style is the same as the "flashback" reality but a lot less dreamy.
- how dreamy is the flashback reality? well try copying Do It Yourself!! that'll solve your problems
