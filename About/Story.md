[[Ayuki Kazune]] wakes up on a platform in a world which she aren't familiar with.
Upon looking around she saw [[The Bridge]] extending into what looks like nothingness.
Intrigued, she builds up the courage to stand up and walk across it.

Upon traversing through the world, she sees colorful clouds and glowing particles.
A glowing aurora as far as the eye can see...
An enchanting scenery but also for some reason quite scary.
She feels this urge to walk away for some reason but she kept going in spite of her better judgement.
