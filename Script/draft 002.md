Author: Vlusky

EXT. SCHOOL FRONT - DREAM # 010 #

AYUKI laid limp on the ground. Her surroundings are unfamiliar.

AYUKI
(slightly struggles standing up)
(takes a look around)

CAMERA spins around AYUKI for a reveal.

A familiar place. Covered in shards of... something.
AYUKI could not fully recall.

AYUKI
(looks forward)
(hesitantly enters the building)

CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DREAM # 020 #

AYUKI looks at her surroundings. Again, it looks familiar to her.
But then just across the room she saw something odd.

AYUKI
(a look to the left and right)
(faces forward)
(surprised)

CAMERA shows a mysterious figure walking to the _left_ of the screen

AYUKI
(follows the figure)

CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DREAM # 030 #

The figure walks along the corridor.

AYUKI
(takes a closer look)

CAMERA shows the figure entering a classroom

AYUKI
(follows)

CUT TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - DREAM # 040 #

AYUKI
(looks slightly surprised)

AYUKI for sure have seen this place before. It inflicts a very specific memory in her mind.

Suddenly she felt a shockwave of emotions.

AYUKI
(slightly disturbed)

CAMERA shows the back of AYUKI and one of the desks in the class.
Said desk looks distinct. It looks broken, barely holding together.

GLITCH TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - REALITY # 050 #

AYUKI is writing sheet music at her desk.
Suddenly a group of people came to her and started tearing the paper.
Subsequently messing up her desk, scribbling it and such.

The bullies proceed to push AYUKI to the back of the class

CAMERA shows AYUKI looking vulnerable, laying on the ground.

AYUKI
(teary eyes)
(why are you guys doing this?)

CAMERA shows the teared up sheets of music

CAMERA shows the bullies from AYUKI's low perspective.

BULLIES
(laughing)

GLITCH TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - DREAM # 060 #

CAMERA is in the same angle as before.
CAMERA shows AYUKI in the same position as the bullies before.

AYUKI
(surprised and a bit touched)
(looks down to ponder)

AYUKI then looks at her desk, which in the dream world just looks like a glitched mess.

AYUKI
(shows acceptance)

The desk would then slowly disintegrates.
Soon, the whole class follows. starting from the position AYUKI was pinned on earlier.

Eventually the whole classroom emits a soft particle, shedding whats left of them.

CAMERA shows AYUKI in the middle of the disintegrating classroom

CUT TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - DREAM

CAMERA shows CLOSE UP of AYUKI looking determined

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - DREAM # 070 #

AYUKI walks to the LEFT side of the screen. Exploring the school further.

CUT TO:

INT. HALLWAY - DREAM

AYUKI saw a room to her RIGHT. Oddly brighter than other rooms adjacent to it.

She decides to inspect that room further

CUT TO:

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DREAM

The room has a few seats with a piano at the front of it.
CAMERA shows an acoustic guitar sitting next to the piano.

AYUKI
(slight look of confusion)
(sudden realization)

GLITCH TO:

INT. MUSIC ROOM - REALITY

Two girls are sitting in that room.

NATSUME sitting across the piano.
AYUKI sat beside NATSUME holding the guitar.

NATSUME
(reassuring look)

AYUKI
(slightly nervous)

AYUKI starts to do an arpeggio with her guitar.

NATSUME plays along with the piano.

AYUKI and NATSUME proceeds to do a duet.

= we don't yet know how long this duet will last. depending on what happens it could be 30s to 60s trimmed and 2m to 3m for the whole song in the OST album

AYUKI and NATSUME plays the home chord.

AYUKI looks at NATSUME with excited
NATSUME smiles back

CAMERA shows them both being happy with each other

GLITCH TO:

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DREAM

CAMERA shows AYUKI from behind, staring at that exact spot.

CAMERA shows AYUKI's expression

AYUKI
(shocked)
(breaks into tears)

AYUKI just remembered what this was, who that person is.

This room is where she truly feels at home, and NATSUME is the person whom she can lean on.

Despite everything she had experienced, this room- the duet- that person...
Is now no longer.

What remains is mere fragments of her memories. Memories of them together. Memories which AYUKI wasn't ready to just... let go.

CAMERA shows a glowing path,
branching from AYUKI's tears which hit the ground.

AYUKI
(stops crying)
(intrigued)

CUT TO:

INT. STAIRWAY - DREAM

AYUKI follows that path.
She now remembers what this place is, but there's one more place she has yet to visit.

CAMERA shows a door to to the school rooftop

AYUKI gently opens the door.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP - DREAM

AYUKI saw a figure standing near the railing.

GLITCH TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP - REALITY

AYUKI stands besides the railing.
Blissfully looking into the distance.

The scenery, the open sky, the distant buildings...
AYUKI feels... free...

The wind gently blowing, the trees quietly brushing.
This place is where she feels the most at peace.

CAMERA shows AYUKI's face

AYUKI
(smiles)

GLITCH TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP - DREAM

AYUKI
(slowly amazed)

The scenery from her memories turned into a beautiful aurora.
The whole field glows bright blue, a bunch of particles flying through the air.

AYUKI walks closer to the railing

CAMERA shows AYUKI's face

= in most cases, try to parallel the framing of the IRL scene with the dream sequence

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP - DREAM

AYUKI knows this won't last forever.

While this scenery is nice, she needs to move on.
She can't just hide in the rooftop forever.
She can't rely on NATSUME anymore.

AYUKI knows, eventually she needs to let this go.
Otherwise she would be shackled by her own memories.

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP - DREAM

AYUKI
(builds up courage)
(closes eyes)

CAMERA shows her surroundings disintegrate.

AYUKI is letting go of her memories

Eventually the floor which AYUKI stood on also disintegrates.
AYUKI falls *backwards*

= which way she fell on the obligatory "falling down" scene is subject to change

AYUKI is finally content on letting everything go.
All those memories she treasured, she won't let them be a burden.

CAMERA shows AYUKI's eyes

ZOOM CUT TO:

INT. FRONT DOOR - REALITY

AYUKI
(shocked "just came back to life" face)
