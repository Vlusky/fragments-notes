Welcome to the Fragments `(codename: cg anime out of spite)` early notes repository!

This entire repo is meant to be opened with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) as a [Vault](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault). Although, due to its plain-text nature, being mainly written in Markdown, you can also browse the text files directly on here (with limitations).

The concept has evolved a bit since I wrote these but it probably can be helpful as occasional reference.

Thank you for reading <3
