EXT. THE BRIDGE - DREAM # 010 #

AYUKI laid limp on the ground. Her surroundings are unfamiliar.

AYUKI
(slightly struggles standing up)
(takes a look around)

CAMERA spins around AYUKI for a reveal.

A scenery that glows a bright blue. Covered in what seems to be shards of... something.

AYUKI
(looks forward)
(notices a bridge)

A bridge that seemingly goes to nowhere. But it looks enticing enough for AYUKI to cross.

AYUKI
(hesitantly takes a step forward)

TITLE CARD: **Fragments**

CUT TO:

EXT. THE BRIDGE - DREAM # 020 #

CAMERA top down slightly tilted, showing AYUKI and THE BRIDGE

THIRD-- Pink sakura trees with falling leaves

(takes a deep breath)
(hesitantly takes a step forward)

CUT TO:

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DREAM # 040 - A #

AYUKI looks at her surroundings. Again, it looks familiar to her.
But then just across the room she saw something odd.

AYUKI
(a look to the left and right)
(faces forward)
(surprised)

AYUKI
(follows the figure)

The figure walks along the corridor.

AYUKI
(takes a closer look)

CAMERA shows the figure entering a classroom

AYUKI
(follows)

CUT TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - DREAM # 050 #

AYUKI
(looks slightly surprised)

AYUKI for sure have seen this place before. It inflicts a very specific memory in her mind.

Suddenly she felt a shockwave of emotions.

AYUKI
(slightly disturbed)

CAMERA shows the back of AYUKI and one of the desks in the class.
Said desk looks distinct. It looks broken, barely holding together.

GLITCH TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - REALITY # 060 #

CAMERA shows the same angle as before.
The desk shown is revealed to be Ayuki's actual desk on her past life.

AYUKI is shown to be in disbelief in what she saw on her desk.

CAMERA cuts to AYUKI's desk.
Various scribbles, all telling AYUKI to get lost. All covered with various pieces of trash.

AYUKI
(a bit sad / annoyed)
(sudden surprised look)

**Someone** called her, presumably in a mocking tone.
THEY would then proceed to push her to the back of the class

CAMERA shows AYUKI looking vulnerable, laying on the ground.

AYUKI
(teary eyes)
(why are you guys doing this?)

CAMERA shows the bullies from AYUKI's low perspective.

THEY
(laughing)

GLITCH TO:

INT. CLASSROOM - DREAM # 070 #

CAMERA is in the same angle as before.
CAMERA shows AYUKI in the same position as the bullies before.

AYUKI
(surprised and a bit touched)
(looks down to ponder)

AYUKI then looks at her desk, which in the dream world just looks like a glitched mess.

AYUKI
(shows acceptance)

The desk would then slowly disintegrates.
Soon, the whole class follows. starting from the position AYUKI was pinned on earlier.

Eventually the whole classroom emits a soft particle, shedding whats left of them.

CAMERA shows AYUKI in the middle of the disintegrating classroom

WHIP PAN TO:

INT. CORRIDOR - DREAM # 080 #

AYUKI walks further into the school.
With a slightly optimistic look, she wants to explore the school further.

While doing so, flashbacks to when her bullies are "playing" with her shows on the background. But AYUKI wasn't fazed.

But then she noticed something odd on a specific classroom.

It sounds like as if *music* is coming out of it.

CUT TO:

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DREAM # 090 #

AYUKI
(looks around)

She notices a PIANO and a GUITAR

CAMERA shows the piano alongside the chair for it.

FADE TO:

INT. MUSIC ROOM - REALITY (SUNSET) # 100 #

CAMERA angle stays the same as the previous scene.
NATSUME plays the piano.

CAMERA shows NATSUME actually hitting the keys

NATSUME
(enjoying her own playing)
(looks to the side)

AYUKI
(plays the guitar)

CAMERA shows AYUKI's finger chord shapes.
The guitar strings vibrating with her playing

AYUKI
(looks happy)
(looks at NATSUME)

AYUKI and NATSUME looks at each other as they finish the piece they're playing together.

They all look happy in this moment.
Both smiled to each other as they end the music session.

CAMERA shows both of them with their respective instruments,
with the background showing a soft sunset beyond the school window.

GLITCH TO:

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DREAM # 110 #

CAMERA is in the same angle as before
CAMERA shows AYUKI just out of frame
Then cuts to show AYUKI's emotions

AYUKI
(disbelief)
(starts tearing up)

This was a place of importance to her.
Of the entire school, which seemed to be against AYUKI.
This is the only room where she felt comfortable
Together with her best *friend* NATSUME.

And now it's gone...
Or is it?

The Music Room didn't disintegrate like the classroom did.

AYUKI then left the room. Giving it one final look before she closes the door.

CUT TO:

INT. STAIRCASE - DREAM # 120 - A #

AYUKI walks upstairs, to the school rooftop
Presumably the final place she haven't visited during this *dream* sequence

CUT TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP - DREAM # 120 - B #

CAMERA shows AYUKI coming out from the building from a far perspective.
CAMERA shows the school railing just out of frame.

FADE TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP - REALITY (DAY) # 130 #

AYUKI is alone on the rooftop.
Leaning towards the railing. Enjoying the time to herself.
Looking into the distance, soaking in the scenery.

All is calm, all is good.

CAMERA shows AYUKI bust up front side.

GLITCH TO:

EXT. ROOFTOP - DREAM # 140 #

From the same angle, CAMERA shows AYUKI still somewhat far from the railing.
CAMERA goes closer to AYUKI's face, showing her emotions.

AYUKI
(amazed)

That scenery she used to enjoy for herself in the times of peace.
Now turned into a magnificent aurora

She takes a closer look. Now leaning on the railing.

But then suddenly,
From behind, the floor on which she stood rapidly began to disintegrate.

AYUKI
(shocked)
(a bit scared)

The ground beneath her begins to disappear.

CUT TO:

EXT. LEFTOVERS - DREAM # 150 #

AYUKI fell inside... a room.
It definitely didn't look like a room from the school building.

But everything there seems... familiar.
Now that she paid attention, it looks much like a rundown version of the Music Room she used to be.

NATSUME's piano, her own guitar, followed by images of them together.
Hung neatly on the wall with a pretty frame.

A culmination of the memories she still hold dearly.
Despite everything that had happened to her in this school already

CAMERA shows a door across from AYUKI.

AYUKI is trapped within her own memories.
She hates the place, and she wanted to move away from it,
But the memories of her with NATSUME is too precious.

AYUKI
(sigh)
(hesitant step forward)

Soon the room began to disintegrate.
She's letting go of that memory.

CAMERA shows AYUKI can now dive forward, no longer needing the door.

*note: why doesn't she need the door? well it's only there for visual aid*

AYUKI
(takes a leap forward)

Epic fall sequence.
All bits of AYUKI's memories now are mere fragments.
They're still inside her mind. But she wouldn't need to be trapped by them anymore.

CAMERA zooms into AYUKI's eyes

EYE TRANSITION TO:

INT. AYUKI'S LIVING ROOM - REALITY (PRESENT) # 160 #

CAMERA zooms out of AYUKI's face

Present day AYUKI.
Her uniform changed. She transfered schools.

AYUKI
(face of realization)
(relief)

By putting the burdens of her past behind, she goes on to living another day.

CAMERA shows AYUKI walking out the door.
